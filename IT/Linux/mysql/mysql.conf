[mysqld]
old_passwords = false # inserted by debconf
# Activate the above for connections from hosts running Debian Woody/Sarge!
#
# Prior to MySQL 5.0, user passwords were stored in a rather weak way. This
# has been improved with the drawback that client programs shipped with
# Debian Woody/Sarge (technically: linked against libmysqlclient.so.12 or
# earlier) cannot connect any more if either their account has either been
# created or their password has been modified using MySQL 5.0.
# See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/old-client.html

# * InnoDB
#
# InnoDB is enabled by default with a 10MB datafile in /var/lib/mysql/.
# Read the manual for more InnoDB related options. There are many!
# You might want to disable InnoDB to shrink the mysqld process by circa 100MB.

# For generating SSL certificates I recommend the OpenSSL GUI "tinyca".
